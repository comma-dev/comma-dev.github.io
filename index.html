            <h3>Who we are</h3>
            <p>Comma Development is a custom Ruby on Rails and software development firm based out of Salt Lake City, Utah.  We employ highly skilled developers and designers trained in standards-based web applications for cleaner, better, faster (and therefore affordable) end products.  Though we are well trained in a variety of programming languages, such as Cold Fusion, Java, AJAX, PHP, and .NET, our expertise is fully leveraged with Ruby on Rails.  In other words, if it isn't Ruby you're looking for, we'll be happy to direct you to another web development shop â€“ and we know some great ones.</p>
            <h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
            <p>We know how important your website is to you, and we are committed to working with you in every step of the development process. When first impressions are lasting impressions, there is nothing more important than creating a website that truly represents your company.  Is your company organized and professional?  Modern and edgy?  Light-hearted and adventurous?  Contemporary and abstract?  You want the look and feel of your site to be just right - we do that!</p>
            <p>We believe that any development project should be simple, straight-forward, and intuitive - easy enough for anyone to understand. We look forward to taking on challenging projects that will spice up your site, make your business more efficient and profitable, and distinguish your company from the competition.  We know you're the best, so why not make your website the best?</p>
            <p>Our mission is to utilize our expertise in design and programming for appealing graphics on the front-end and robust programming on the back-end. Whether you want animation, video, and music on the front-end or back-end programming with e-mail capture, site admin, accounts, bar-codes, touchscreen applications, or photo galleries, we do it all.  Take a chance on us - you won't be disappointed.</p>
